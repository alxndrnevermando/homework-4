# homework-4

I really struggled with this one. I look forward to growing as a student, and challenging projects like the one we had for homework exemplifies the need to keep working and studying. I did not complete this project entirely, I was unable to get it to function, and was not able to get it perform most of the requirements of the homework. But, I can say that I still am impressed with what I was able to come up with, and am sure that with some guidance, I could be doing a lot better and more impressive work.

## Motivation

I knew this was going to be tough, so I'm just glad I was able to get an understnding of what the assignment required, even if I did not fully achieve what was assigned.
